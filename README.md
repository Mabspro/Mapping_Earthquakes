# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
This was a project to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, as well as seeing all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. This would also include this data on a third map.

Resources:
Data Source: tectonic_plate_starter_logic.js, tectonic_plate_starter_logic.js, tectonic_plate_starter_logic.js and index.html
Data Tools: JavaScript, JSON, GeoJSON and IO (Web Server)
Software: ES6+, ECMAScript and Visual Studio Code 1.50.0
For more information, visit The Mapbox API.

Tech Utilized:
- Leaflet.js API for Geo map info

## Results

All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off.

Below are the maps and how they load when they are toggled:
